# Building the Data
Answer the following based on our initial, simplified dataset of enrollments, plan types, and service areas:

\noindent 1. Provide a table of the count of hospitals with multiple reports filed in one year

```{r} 
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-plans
#| tbl-cap: Multiple reports

multi_report_counts <- duplicate.hcris %>%
  group_by(fyear) %>%
  summarise(num_hospitals = n_distinct(provider_number))
ggplot(multi_report_counts, aes(x = fyear, y = num_hospitals)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Hospitals Filing Multiple Reports Per Year",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Hospitals",
    caption = "Source: HCRIS Data (1996 & 2010 Versions)"
  ) +
  theme_classic()
